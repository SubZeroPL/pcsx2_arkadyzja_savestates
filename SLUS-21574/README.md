**Description:**

The game begins at the moment you meet Faye. A second player can assist you if you insert another controller into controller port 2. This gives your partner control over the selection and casting of Faye's spells and allows him or her to scroll through slingshot ammunition for you. (Controls are the same as for player 1.) Having help like this in a pinch can be a real timesaver, especially when the fighting gets frantic.
